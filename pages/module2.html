<H2>Introduction</H2>

The principal question regarding Embedded Software Design is the following:
<BR><BR><div style="text-align: center;">
    <B>"What are the essential models that describe the structure and behavior of
        real-time embedded systems?</B>
</div><BR>

For simple systems, the structure can be simple and it is usually an automaton, that
is, a sequential program, whose behavior is described by a state-transition diagram,
which can be usually modeled as a flowchart.  This is illustrated in Figure 1, for
reading a temperature sensor.<BR>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <IMG SRC="pages/img/Flowchart.jpg" ALIGN=Center BORDER=0 WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=500><BR>
    Fig. 1.  Example of a Simple Model Describing Behavior of an Embedded System<BR>
    (for Temperature Sensor Readout).<BR>
</div>

<P>
    This kind of model is usually sufficient
    for devices, such as a microwave oven or a washing machine.  For more complicated
    systems, such as traffic light control system, the number of variables is so large
    that simplistic models are inadequate to capture system's behavior and more
    sophisticated approaches need to be used.  Several kinds of mathematical models for
    real-time computing systems have been developed in the past, of which the following
    are worth mentioning:

<MENU>
    <LI> finite state machines
    <LI> differential equations
    <LI> queuing theory
    <LI> rule-based computations.
</MENU>

In this course, we focus on finite state machine models.  In order to be useful, the
model has to capture the principal characteristics of the real-time embedded system,
which allow predicting its behavior and thus controlling it.  Normally, on
the basis of System and Software Requirements Specification for the device, the
designer should be able to produce the first model of the system, very primitive but
including the necessary information of interfacing our software with the surrounding
environment: Context Diagram.  Producing the Context Diagram is the first step in good
real-time software design, because it defines the interactions with the environment,
by describing all input/output characteristics, including:

<MENU>
    <LI> sources, destinations and directions of all information flows to and from the
        software, that is, input/output information
    <LI> physical form and logical format of the information flow
    <LI> quantities, units of measure, and accuracy of information
    <LI> data types and ranges of validity
    <LI> illegal values and error messages
    <LI> timing and frequency of temporal elements of information flow
    <LI> operator actions, etc.
</MENU>

This is illustrated in Figure 2 for a microwave oven controller, as far as sources
and destinations of information flows (signals) are concerned, without detailing
their physical form, quantities, ranges, timing, etc.<BR>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <IMG SRC="pages/img/OvenContextDiag.jpg" ALIGN=Center BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=450><BR>
    Fig. 2.  Example of a Context Diagram for a Microwave Oven Controller.<BR>
</div>

<P>
    The input/output information determines the top-level software architecture of
    real-time embedded software, because it can be always categorized into four basic
    groups:

<MENU>
    <LI> device (physical process) inputs and outputs
    <LI> operator interface I/O
    <LI> communication link I/O
    <LI> database inputs and outputs.
</MENU>

The idea of dividing I/O information into different categories, which later determine
the software architecture, follows the fundamental engineering principle of separation
of concerns, formulated by David Parnas in the early 1970s ("On the Criteria to be
Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules, Communications of the ACM, Vol. 15, No. 12,
pp. 1053-1058, December 1972).  Consequently, the input/output dependencies determine
the basic components of the embedded software architecture, enhanced by the
computational (processing) and timing components, as listed below:

<MENU>
    <LI> sensor/actuator component
    <LI> user interface component
    <LI> communication link component
    <LI> database component
    <LI> processing component, and
    <LI> timing component.
</MENU>

The two additional components, included In addition to the four primary components
corresponding to four groups of input/output information, are the necessary parts
of the software architecture, because:

<MENU>
    <LI> the computational (processing) component is the glue connecting all primary
        components, which either supply data for or receive data from processing
    <LI> the timing component, which is necessary in most real-time systems.
</MENU>

This assumption leads to a generic top-level architecture of a real-time embedded
system composed of a few software components interacting with the environment and
exchanging data among themselves, what is illustrated in Figure 3, in a form which
be called a soccer-ball architecture (device I/O is split into the Measurement
and Control modules).<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>
    From this top-level view of the software being developed, one can derive more
    detailed design models using any of the two primary approaches or their mixture:

<MENU>
    <LI> Structured (functional) approach, or
    <LI> Object-oriented approach.
</MENU>

Using special software development tools, such as
<A HREF="http://www-142.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/ratirhapfami/"> Rhapsody </A> and
<A HREF="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/developer/technical/"> Rose
    RealTime </A>, helps in automatizing the design process.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

The principal question regarding Embedded and Cyberphysical Systems Programming is the following:
<BR><BR><div style="text-align: center;">
    <B>"What are the essential issues, which make programming for Embedded and Cyberphysical Systems <BR>
        different from conventional programming?"</B>
</div><BR>

Nowadays, computers become a significant part of our everyday life, determining
the way we acquire knowledge, interact with people, conduct business and
act professionaly.  In the form of microprocessors and microcontrollers, they penetrate
every single aspect of our lives by becoming <I>embedded</I> in washing machines,
microwave ovens, cash registers, teller machines, cell phones, PDA's, watches,
digital cameras, cars, traffic lights, gates, trains, railroad crossings, airplanes,
spacecraft, air traffic control, etc., etc., not only controlling chemical plants,
nuclear reactors, and insurance and banking operations, in which they have been used
for some time.  It is the <I>embedded</I> feature, which makes them different from
traditional computers, therefore a different approach has to be used to program them.
In addition, most of these systems, if not all of them, are interconnected, allowing access
from remote locations, essentially to anyone, thus becoming <I>cyberphysical</I> systems,
so the issue of information security becomes critically important.

<P>
    The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (IEEE Std. 610-12),
    <A HREF="http://computer.org/sevocab">accessible online</A>,
    defines an <B>Embedded Computer System</B> as <U><I> a computer system that is a part
    of a larger system and performs some of the requirements of that system.</I></U>
    It means that an embedded computer is always a part of a larger installation, whose
    purpose is not necessarily (and usually is not) computational.  Among the essential
    characteristics of embedded computers one can find the following:

<UL>
    <LI> interaction with the environment via sensors and actuators
    <LI> real-time operation to respond to external stimuli or service requests on time
    <LI> inherently concurrent operation to perform multiple functions at a time
    <LI> strict integration of hardware and software in a host/target development
        environment
    <LI> particular focus on reliabile and safe operation.
</UL>

Due to the widespread use of embedded and cyberphysical systems, it is essential for every Software
Engineering or Computer Science student to learn and understand principles of
Embedded Systems Programming.  This is especially true for a special kind of
embedded systems called <B> real-time systems</B>, which are defined as <U><I>computer
    systems with bounded response time.</I></U>  Nowadays, due to pervasiveness of the Internet
and other networks, embedded systems have expanded due to connectivity and are becoming
what is known as <B>Cyberphysical Systems</B>, that is, <I>embedded systems with Internet connectivity.</I>
This first lecture is only an introduction
to Embedded Systems and provides some background information on the basic concepts
used in developing them.

<P>
    The "big picture" of building such systems may be captured in four basic layers,
    as illustrated in Figure 1.  The Specification and Design layer includes requirements
    formulation, designing software architecture, mapping requirements to the design,
    and developing detailed design with the use of special notation, such as
    <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/769.html">UML</A>
    (Unified Modeling Language).
    In the Software Engineering program, these aspects of software development are covered in
    two separate courses, respectively:
<MENU>
    <LI> CEN 3073 Software Specifications
    <LI> <A HREF="http://itech.fgcu.edu/faculty/zalewski/CEN4065/CEN4065.html">
        CEN 4064 Software Architecture and Design </A>
</MENU>

The professional development is done with support of automatic design tools, such as
<A HREF="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ratirhapdesiforsystengi"> Rhapsody </A> or
<A HREF="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/developer/technical/"> Rose
    RealTime</A>, which are now controlled by IBM.
These tools are based on finite-state machines (similar to state diagrams) and may
generate most of the code for the <B>target system</B>, that is, <U><I>an embedded
    system for which the software is being developed</I></U>.  A different category of
tools that are also used at this level, those based on differential equation models,
such as <A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com"> Matlab/Simulink </A> or
<A HREF="http://www.ni.com/matrixx/"> MatrixX </A>, can also generate target code,
based on a different principle more suitable for a different course
<I>CDA 4170 Data Acquisition and Control Systems</I>, which is
periodically offered as an elective at FGCU as well.

    Fig. 1.  Essential Layers of Developing Embedded and Cyberphysical Systems.<BR>
</div>

<P>
    An overview of the tools for real-time embedded applications is presented in Figure 2.
    It maps the layered diagram from Figure 1 onto a sequence of tool uses, from
    requirements specification, through programming, down to the code running on the
    target system under RTOS (Real-Time Operating System).  However, the picture presented
    in Figure 2 is incomplete in a sense that a significant amount of embedded systems is
    designed down to the hardware level and involves the circuit and chip design process,
    with such high-level tools as
    <A HREF="http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/vlsi/slides/vhdl.html"> VHDL </A> or <A HREF="http://www.verilog.com"> Verilog
</A>.  This course, however, is strictly a <I>programming course</I>, and although
    embedded hardware design is an important issue, it lies beyond the scope of this particular class
    and normally covered at FGCU in a class on
    <A HREF="http://itech.fgcu.edu/faculty/zalewski/CDA3200/CDA3200.html">Digital Systems</A>.<BR><BR>

    Fig. 2.  Classification of High-Level Tools for Developing Embedded Systems.<BR>
</div>

<P>
    Developing software designs with graphical models, produced by the tools such as
    Rhapsody or Rose RealTime, facilitates the development
    process, however, a good deal of programming is still needed, even if the code is
    generated by the design tool.  Programming environments, called Integrated Developemnt
    Environments (IDE's), as shown in Figure 2, assist in the programming process by
    integrating such programming activities as editing, compiling, executing and debugging
    programs.  One such environment, which has gained wide popularity among
    programmers is <A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/"> Eclipse</A>.  Its value lies
    in the fact that it can act as an IDE for many different languages, including
    C/C++ and Java, and it is open source.

<P>
    Regarding the use of Programming Language at level 2 from Figure 1, the developers
    need to know specific programming constructs to ensure reliable and safe operation of
    an embedded application.  This involves mostly constructs related to <B>concurrency</B>
    (in particular languages called <I>multitasking</I> or <I>multithreading</I>),
    to control program behavior with respect to such phennomena as:
<MENU>
    <LI> mutual exclusion
    <LI> deadlock
    <LI> starvation
    <LI> re-entrancy
    <LI> context switching
    <LI> priority inversion
    <LI> drift and jitter, etc.
</MENU>

<P>
    Surprisingly, the language which is best suited to resolve some of these issues and
    has respective features built in, <A HREF="http://www.gnat.com/"> Ada</A>, is not
    very popular among embedded systems developers, except for the military applications.
    Other languages, such as Java, have features somehow contradicting the best programming
    practices for embedded systems, therefore a separate standard has been developed for
    <A HREF="http://www.rtsj.org/"> Real-Time Java.</A>
    Languages most commonly used in embedded systems, that is C/C++ and assembly, do not
    have respective constructs at all, therefore they rely heavily on underlying operating
    system kernel constructs (third level in Figure 1), among which the most important are:

<MENU>
    <LI> scheduling (assigning units of concurrency to the processor)
    <LI> intertask sychronization and communication (to let the tasks coordinate operation)
    <LI> signals (notifying tasks/threads about events that occur)
    <LI> timers (allowing to set time for generating specific events).
</MENU>

A wide array of real-time kernels have been developed over the last 30 years or so,
that incorporate some or all of the features listed above.  For use in this course,
we have available one of the most successful kernels, VxWorks, with its Eclipse-based
IDE named
<A HREF="http://www.windriver.com/products/development_suite">
    Workbench</A> (courtesy Wind River Systems), which replaced their older IDE named
Tornado.  VxWorks is particularly suited for, so called, hard real-time systems, with
strictly bounded response time, but softer embedded systems, where embedded computer's
response time is not that critical, can use other operating systems, such as a version
of Linux, Windows CE and many others.

<P>
    Although hardware issues, extremely important in developing embedded systems, are
    not the focus of this class, students need to learn some fundamental programming
    concepts related to hardware, such as interrupt handling, device interfacing and
    register access, bus operation, device drivers, etc.  Knowledge of a variety of
    peripheral devices used in embedded
    systems, such as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, timers and
    counters, UART's (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), stepping motors,
    LED's (Light Emitting Diodes) and LCD's (Liquid Crystal Displays), keypads, and others,
    and their interfacing to specific buses from the programmer's standpoint is illustrated
    in the <A HREF="http://www.sealevel.com/knowledgebase/article.asp?article_id=65">
    The Digital I/O Handbook </A>.

<P>
    Finally, recognizing the fact that students must be aware of the operation of
    general purpose microprocessors or microcontrollers and specific embedded systems
    processors, such as ARM, MC68HC11, or Intel 8751, including DSP's (Digital Signal
    Processors), PLC's (Programmable Logic Controllers), as well as respective memory
    devices and chips, we only mention them here, discussing related issues in one lecture,
    with an example of one particular 8-bit microcontroler from ATMEL .  We do the same with
    knowledge related to building hardware that involves designing ASIC's (Application Specific
    Integrated Circuits), PLD's (Programmable Logic Devices), FPGA's (Field Programmable
    Gate Arrays), etc., all important to embedded systems engineering, but covered
    in this course only at the VHDL programming level (VHDL stand for V[ery High Speed Integrated
    Circuits] Hardware Design Language).  In summary, in this class we use a top-down approach to learning
    about Embedded and Cyberphysical Systems, from developing software designs, to the use of programming
    languages, to real-time kernel operation, and hardware, as illustrated in Figure 1.
